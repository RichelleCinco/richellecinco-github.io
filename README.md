# SCOPE

This is my portfolio as part of my finals submission project for CS601 Wed Dev Application. 

## Features

Use of:

- Flexbox
- CSS grid
- React
- Javascript
- JSON
- Media Queries
- Gallery

### Challenges

- Menu toggle. I was not able to figure out how to fix it in time. I tried to troubleshoot.
- Failing to add my DOM update and Drop and Drag project due to React conversion - ran out of time.
